### Common Data Environment (CDE) allows project teams to create, organise and share information to foster collaboration, make timely decisions and take early interventions during the project’s delivery and building maintenance lifecycle. Data Standards specify what information is required for a building project and how it can be structured to facilitate sharing and collaboration among project team members using a Common Data Environment.
