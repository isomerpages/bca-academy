Our buildings are an important part of Singapore’s climate change mitigation strategy and can directly contribute to more efficient energy use. This is why it is important for the built environment to be designed, constructed and operated as green and sustainably as possible.

  <p>While considerable progress has been made, we can set our sets higher amidst the global call for greater ambition and Singapore’s raised commitments under the Long-term Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) for 2050. In the next wave of Singapore’s Green Building movement, the sector will push the boundaries for best-in-class energy performance and cost-effective Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings.</p>
