### Integrated green buildings strategies in building a greener and more environmentally sustainable Singapore for all. 

Singapore is a highly urbanised island state, with buildings accounting for over 20% of Singapore’s emissions. Hence, this is an important aspect of our transformation--to remake our city to meet the challenges of climate change. Green buildings is an important part of our climate change mitigation strategy, and this is why it is important for the built environment to be designed, constructed and operated as green and sustainably as possible. In 2009, Singapore’s Inter-Ministerial Committee on Sustainable Development (IMCSD) set a target to green at least 80% of the buildings’ gross floor area (GFA) in Singapore by 2030.

While considerable progress has been made, we can set our sets higher amidst the global call for greater ambition and Singapore’s raised commitments under the Long-term Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) for 2050. In the next wave of Singapore’s Green Building movement, the sector will push the boundaries for best-in-class energy performance and cost-effective Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings.
