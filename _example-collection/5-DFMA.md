### Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) involves construction being designed for manufacturing off-site in a controlled environment, before being assembled on-site. The DfMA approach is leading the transformation of the BE sector through leveraging advanced technology, improved quality & precision of construction while reducing reliance on manpower & achieving higher productivity.

<em><p> </p></em>
<ul>
  <li>DfMA comprises a continuum of technologies and methodologies that promote offsite fabrication </li>
  <li>These technologies range from prefabricated components to fully integrated assemblies across the Structural, Architectural, and Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) disciplines.</li>
</ul>
