### Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) is a game-changing method of construction which involves construction being designed for manufacturing off-site in a controlled environment, before being assembled on-site.

DfMA comprises a continuum of technologies and methodologies that promote offsite fabrication. These technologies range from prefabricated components to fully integrated assemblies across the Structural, Architectural, and Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) disciplines. The DfMA approach is leading the transformation of the the Built Environment sector through leveraging advanced technology, improved quality and precision of construction while reducing the reliance on manpower and ultimately, higher productivity

<blockquote>
  <p>The Government aims to make DfMA the default way of building. "We are fundamentally changing the way we build through DfMA. This way, construction becomes faster, cleaner, quieter and of high quality" (Minister of State for National Development Zaqy Mohamad) </p>

#### Did you know that buildings account for over 20% of emissions in Singapore?

Our buildings are an important part of Singaporeâ€™s climate change mitigation strategy and can directly contribute to more efficient energy use. This is why it is important for the built environment to be designed, constructed and operated as green and sustainably as possible.
