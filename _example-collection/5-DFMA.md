### Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) involves construction being designed for manufacturing off-site in a controlled environment, before being assembled on-site. The DfMA approach is leading the transformation of the BE sector through leveraging advanced technology, improved quality & precision of construction while reducing reliance on manpower & achieving higher productivity
