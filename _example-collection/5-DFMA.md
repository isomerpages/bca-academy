### Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) is a game-changing method of construction which involves construction being designed for manufacturing off-site in a controlled environment, before being assembled on-site. It comprises a continuum of technologies and methodologies that promote offsite fabrication. These technologies range from prefabricated components to fully integrated assemblies across the Structural, Architectural, and Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) disciplines.

### The DfMA approach is leading the transformation of the the Built Environment sector through leveraging advanced technology, improved quality and precision of construction while reducing the reliance on manpower and ultimately, higher productivity
