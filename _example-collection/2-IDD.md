**Sustainable Development â€“ A Core Belief**

![Sustainable Development](/images/framework/manifesto_sustainabledevelopment.jpg)

Climate change is an existential threat of our times. It has brought rising sea levels and extreme weather patterns. Around the world, millions of lives and livelihoods are in danger. Singapore, as a low-lying island state, is particularly vulnerable.

Sustainable development is not new to Singapore. We embraced it decades before climate change became a critical global priority.

Today, Singapore is a City in a Garden, and is one of the greenest cities in the world. We set aside large nature reserves, with about a third of our island covered by trees.

We knew public cleanliness and hygiene were important to prevent diseases in our hot and humid urban environment, and took tough measures to enforce them.

We are the only country in the world to freeze the growth of the vehicle population. We are one of a few countries to have closed the water loop and to reuse every last drop of water repeatedly. We don&#39;t subsidise the use of fossil fuel, and we tax the emission of carbon.

We will build upon what we have already done and launch a sustainable development movement for a better and greener future. This will strengthen ongoing efforts to implement our commitments under the [United Nation&#39;s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/).

We have put together a ten-year plan called the **Singapore Green Plan 2030**. The Green Plan is a whole-of-nation sustainable development agenda, with firm action plans, touching on almost every dimension of our lives.
