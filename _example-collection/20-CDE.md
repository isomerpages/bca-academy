### Common Data Environment (CDE) allows project teams to create, organise and share information to foster collaboration, make timely decisions and take early interventions during the projectâ€™s delivery and building maintenance lifecycle. Data Standards specify what information is required for a building project and how it can be structured to facilitate sharing and collaboration among project team members using a Common Data Environment.
