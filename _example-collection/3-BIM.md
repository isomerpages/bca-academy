### Building Information Modelling (BIM) has become a crucial tool to help building professionals improve their effectiveness & efficiency as building projects are becoming complex.

As an integrated design, documentation and construction tool, the strategic implementation of BIM in building projects enhances communication & multi-disciplinary collaboration among the various project stakeholders. This significantly improves the design, construction & operation processes with productivity gains & returns.

**Here are the key programmes of the Green Plan:**

	<div class="accordion-content">
		By 2030, Singapore will be a green and beautiful City in Nature. We will set aside <b>50% more land – around 200 hectares – for nature parks. Every household will live within a 10-minute walk of a park.</b><br><br>
		We will plant one million more trees across our island, which will sequester another 78,000 tonnes of CO2. Singaporeans will enjoy cleaner air, and cooler shade.<br><br>
		With more green spaces, there will be more wildlife amongst us – from migratory birds and hornbills, to otters and mousedeer. But some animals like wild boar and monkeys may get into conflict with people too. We will work with communities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to develop programmes to allow humans and wildlife to live in harmony.<br><br>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		Cleaner and better use of energy is core to any plan to tackle climate change.<br><br>
		Geographical constraints limit our options for renewable energy. We do not have great rivers for hydro power. We have neither land nor sea space for large solar or wind farms. Despite these challenges, we will strive to use cleaner energy, and become more energy efficient.<br><br>
		We have shifted to using natural gas, which is the cleanest fossil fuel. We will <b>quadruple our solar energy deployment by 2025, including covering the roof tops of</b> our <b>HDB</b> (public housing) <b>blocks with solar panels.</b> By 2030, solar energy deployed will be five times that of today. With at least 2 gigawatt-peak, it can power more than 350,000 households a year. We are also looking to <b>tap green energy sources from the ASEAN region and beyond</b>, through electricity imports and hydrogen.<br><br>
		We will invest in water research and development, to halve the energy required to produce desalinated water. By this year (2021), with floating solar panels on reservoirs, <b>all our local waterworks will be powered by solar energy.</b><b> Our waste treatment facilities, such as Tuas Nexus, will be energy-positive.</b><br><br>
		Through measures like the widespread use of smart LED lights and solar energy, we can <b>use 15% less energy</b> in HDB towns by 2030. Beyond HDB towns, we will <b>green 80% of all buildings</b> over the next decade.<br><br>
		We will develop <b>eco-friendly districts</b> as demonstration projects that we can scale up. Jurong Lake District will be a model sustainable mixed-use district, with district cooling, solar power deployment and super low-energy buildings.<br><br>
		We can make vehicles cleaner. All new public buses are already hybrid or electric. We can do the same for private cars.<br><br>
		Singapore&#39;s urban environment makes us an ideal city for adopting electric vehicles or EVs. We have declared our 2040 vision: to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles, and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy. To get there, we will require <b>all newly-registered cars to be cleaner-energy models</b> by 2030.<br><br>
		To support the growth of EVs, we will <b>more than double our EV charging point targets</b> – from 28,000 to 60,000 by 2030. We will tap the capabilities of the private sector to build up this infrastructure. We will also revise the vehicle tax structure to <b>make it easier to buy and own EVs</b>.<br><br>
		All these efforts, in industries, residential estates, commercial buildings and private transport, will reduce our energy consumption by more than 8 million megawatt hours per year. This amount of energy is sufficient to power almost all our households&#39; annual energy use in 2030. This will in turn <b>reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 3 million tonnes per year by 2030</b>.<br><br>
		As a responsible global citizen, Singapore will play our part as part of a larger international solution. We already host the largest bio-diesel plant in the world, which is being expanded. As an aviation and maritime hub, Singapore will play active and important roles in fulfilling two international aspirational goals:<br><br>
		In Aviation: 2% improvement in fuel efficiency every year until 2050, and carbon-neutral growth from 2020.<br><br>
		In Maritime: reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels.<br>
