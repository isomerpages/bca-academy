### Building Information Modelling (BIM) has become a crucial tool to help building professionals improve their effectiveness & efficiency as building projects are becoming complex.

As an integrated design, documentation and construction tool, the strategic implementation of BIM in building projects enhances communication & multi-disciplinary collaboration among the various project stakeholders. This significantly improves the design, construction & operation processes with productivity gains & returns.

#### BIM Dimensions
Linking extra 'dimensions' of data to your information models has the potential to give you a richer understanding of your construction project - how it will be delivered, what it will cost and how it should be maintained.

#### How does BIM optimise each phase of the construction process?

<div style="background-color:#e8e8e8;">
<em><p>BIM can be implemented in different ways throughout a projectâ€™s life cycle:</p></em>
<ul>
  <li>Design and planning: It is a very useful tool for simulation, prototyping and analysis, and it also allows for the inclusion of data from laser scanners. It works as a data repository for the optimised design and performance analytics.</li>
  <li>Construction phase: It collaborates in the exchange of information with project management tools, in the monitoring of construction work, and in the coordination with suppliers, among other aspects</li>
  <li>Operations and maintenance: This methodology is very practical for deliveries and orders, as a data repository for service management systems, for predictive maintenance and for the renovation and termination of works.</li>
</ul>
