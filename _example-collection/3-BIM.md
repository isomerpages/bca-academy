As an integrated design, documentation and construction tool, the strategic implementation of BIM in building projects enhances communication & multi-disciplinary collaboration among the various project stakeholders. This significantly improves the design, construction & operation processes with productivity gains & returns.

**How does BIM optimise each phase of the construction process?**

BIM can be implemented in different ways throughout a projectâ€™s life cycle:

- Design and planning: It is a very useful tool for simulation, prototyping and analysis, and it also allows for the inclusion of data from laser scanners. It works as a data repository for the optimised design and performance analytics.
- Construction phase: It collaborates in the exchange of information with project management tools, in the monitoring of construction work, and in the coordination with suppliers, among other aspects.
- Operations and maintenance: This methodology is very practical for deliveries and orders, as a data repository for service management systems, for predictive maintenance and for the renovation and termination of works.
